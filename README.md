# py-dns
With this module, we can convert an IP address into a name object, whose value will be the reverse map domain name of the address. 


We can find out which domain name corresponds to each of the specified addresses, that is, whether they are IPv4 or IPv6.
It accepts the domain as a parameter and gets information about the IPv4 and IPv6 DNS records.
